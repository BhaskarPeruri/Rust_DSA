## Algorithm:

1. Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula: n \* (n + 1) / 2
2. Calculate the actual sum of all elements in the array
3. The difference between expected and actual sum is the missing number

## Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array

## Space Complexity: O(1) - only using a few variables
